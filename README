Acme-TextLayout

Lay out patterns in Text, and provide facilities for mapping this to a
real-world coordinate space, and figuring out the relationship between
text blocks.

For example:

  AAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCC
  AAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCC
  DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDCCC
  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCC
  FFFFFFFGGGGGGGGHHH

After instantiation, this pattern is known for all the spatial relationships
of all of the characters, and how big the contiguous blocks of like
characters are, etc. See perdoc for more info and methods.

Note that this module required Perl6::Attributes, but that is NOT
Perl6. It just pulls some Perl6 niceness into Perl5.
